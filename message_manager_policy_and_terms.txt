Privacy Policy

Effective Date: October 5, 2024

1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, and protect information obtained from interactions with our Instagram business account through our automated service. This service classifies incoming direct messages (DMs) and may generate responses based on user requests. By using this service, you agree to the terms described here.

2. Information Collection and Use

The Doodlebug Message Manager does not store any user DMs. Incoming DMs are automatically classified to determine whether they are requests for image generation. If classified as an image generation request, the service interacts with the doodlebug.me image generation service to create an image and return it to the user. The Doodlebug Message Manager does not store or use messages for any other purposes.

3. Sharing of Information

We do not share, sell, or disclose any user information. The content of DMs is used solely for generating appropriate responses, such as providing requested images, and nothing is retained or transmitted to third parties for purposes beyond the image generation.

4. Security

We take the security of user data very seriously. Although no data is stored, the service processes messages securely and ensures that all communications are encrypted through Instagram's platform.

5. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect any changes in our practices. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting, and continued use of our services implies acceptance of the updated policy.

6. Contact Us
